## Overview

You created awesome project.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's completed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your users are happy. 

But now you are left with this question:

> All this TailwindCSS clutter...what should I do with it?

You know what I'm talking about. Due to rapid development, we prefer to put Tailwind classes directly into your divs.

As time goes, this clutter grows.

This tool aim to:

- Provide analysis of your project
- Identify common uses of Tailwind class
- Cleanup for large projects

Once your project grows and ready for your users, chances are you are left with
humongous task of Tailwind CSS cleanup.

**Roadmap progress**

- [x] Project identification/init
- [x] Single file analysis
- [ ] User own class exclusion (if specified)
- [ ] Single file de-cluttering
- [ ] Full project analysis
- [ ] Full project auto de-clutter

## Bleeding Edge!
