## Tail Draft

You created awesome project, it's completed, your users are happy. But now you are left with this question:

> What am I going to do with this TailwindCSS class clutter?

You know what I'm talking about.

```html
<div class="border rounded-md px-4 py-2 bg-primary-100">
    <!-- -->
</div>
```

What if we can help you, if not a bit?

```html
<div class="adkuioqa">
    <!-- -->
</div>
```

We'll cleanup your html files and organize the CSSes. You can then choose what to name them.

`adkuioqa = .btn`
```
<div class="btn">
    <!-- -->
</div>
```

## Concept

This is currently in ideation, but me myself are eagerly waiting to try this myself.

I have a huge codebase that needs cleanup.
